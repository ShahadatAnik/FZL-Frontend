          Equipped with various cutting-edge experimental and inspection
          devices, we monitor the whole process ranging from raw materials to
          the finished products, including the examination of the precision of
          molds & equipment accessories, chemical composition content, heavy
          metal content, physical properties, crystal structure, color fastness
          and so forth, all of which make sure that every index conforms with
          the standard requirements for zippers and goes above the customers’
          requirements. We have passed the certifications of ISO9001:2015,
