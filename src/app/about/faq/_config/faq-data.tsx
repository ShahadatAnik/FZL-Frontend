    question:
      'Will any dye transfer occur when white (light color) fabrics are used together with red (dark color/bright color) zippers?',
    answer:
      'Please confirm with our sales persons when you place an order. We can decrease the chances of dye transfer by improving the color fastness. Please note this might result in greater color difference. Additionally, a piece of lining cloth shall be used for separating the zipper from the fabric when sewing is performed.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Will any dye transfer occur with the tapes?',
    answer:
      'Generally speaking, the color fastness reaches Grade 4 for most colors and Grade 3.5 for some special colors, for example, bright red. However, dye transfer would occur as a result of the chemical reaction that will easily take place between the dispersed dye molecules in the zipper tapes and the plasticizer, adhesive agent, oiling agent contained in such fabrics as vinyl chloride that contains DOP, synthetic leather or fabrics whose surface is coated with resin. Hence, a piece of lining cloth shall be used for separating the fabric from the zipper when sewing is performed and the products in custody or storage should be separated from each other using the leatheroid.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'How to select a metal zipper according to the thickness of the fabrics?',
    answer:
      'A metal zipper with 4#+ square teeth is required for fabrics thicker than 12 ounces (340.2 grams), which can reduce the possibility of damage caused to the zipper. Metal zippers with 3# or 4# common teeth would easily break down in use in this case, with the teeth dropping off, splitting, etc.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can any washing technique be applied to the metal zippers?',
    answer:
      'Due to the diversity and complexity of the technologies involved in the washing process, customers are required to provide the washing method of the products for our assessment when placing an order.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'Would the central seam in nylon zippers with reverse slider be the same as that in the invisible zippers?',
    answer:
      'It is inadvisable to lay too much emphasis on the central seam, which may result in abnormal opening and closing of the zippers. Generally speaking, the central seam ranges from 0.3mm to 0.6mm.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'Will any color change occur if the nickel-free platinum accessories are used together with the woolen products?',
    answer:
      'Color change will occur easily when the nickel-free platinum accessories are used together with the cotton or woolen products, such as getting black, yellow, etc., which can be mainly attributed to the chemical reactions that take place between the residues introduced in bleaching, processing, etc. Despite the protective treatment applied, the chemical reactions cannot be eliminated. To prevent any chemical reactions, please make sure the fabrics have been fully cleaned to a neutral state before batch production.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'Would you please explain the great color difference at the front and back of the water-resistant zippers with adhesive tape?',
    answer:
      'Due to the characteristics of TPU, special reinforcement treatment is applied to ensure its firmness of binding with the tape. The complex reaction involved in the recombination process leads to darker colors. The darker the color, the greater the difference. There has not been any technology that can break through the great color difference by far. Please confirm with us before you place an order. Besides, please try to select from the 36 types of colors that are available for use.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you control the shrinkage rate of the zippers?',
    answer:
      'The shrinkage rate falls below 4% and 1.5% for the nylon chains and finished products respectively, exclusive of some special products. The former also applies to the coated zippers, colored teeth & tapes, 3# nylon zippers as well as invisible zippers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can the metal zippers match the spray-painted sliders?',
    answer:
      'No. The paint will easily peel off due to the internal friction, which in turn will lead to the exposure of the zinc alloy. Fading will occur as a result of the electrolysis reaction that takes place easily between the exposed zinc alloy and the copper contained in the laundry detergent during laundering.',
  },
  {
    question:
      'Do you manufacture molded & coated nylon zippers with open end (O/E) or closed end(C/E)?',
    answer:
      'No. This is one of the very few types of zippers that we don’t manufacture.',
